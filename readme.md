### Summary

Simple browser extension that checks the current URL, and displays a banner at the top of the page warning them of dubious content.

The initial was a simple [proof-of-concept](http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/11/heres-a-browser-extension-that-will-flag-fake-news-sites.html) to show steps users and developers could take to combat prolific producers of online misinformation.


### some other stuff

I am not a professional coder. If you are one, and have a better idea for implementation or added features, please feel free to contribute.

This program is not perfect. For one thing, it works off of a static, incomplete list of websites. If there is one feature that should be added, it is the ability to tweak and customize that list as needed.

But for now, this is what we’ve got.

## OpenFact

I am not a professional coder either, but hate fake news and content farm, therefore established the website "OpenFact" to fight against these website. I am trying to add more function to the program, but if you do have any modification, please send us an email via support@openfact.space .
